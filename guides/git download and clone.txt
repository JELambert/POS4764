Go to this website:
https://git-scm.com/downloads

Now open either the terminal (MAC) or command prompt(windows).

navigate through the terminal or command prompt with these two commands:
1: cd
2: cd ..

The first will change directory to whatever you specify and the second will go backwards.

Navigate to a folder you want to clone the repo in. Could be something like this:
cd Desktop

Finally just type:
git clone https://github.com/JELambert/POS4764.git
